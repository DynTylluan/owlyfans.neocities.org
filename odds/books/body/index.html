Crucial Interventions: An Illustrated Treatise on the Principles &#x26; Practice of Nineteenth-Century Surgery</p>
<p>
Very grizzly book showing medical illustrations with little to noting hidden. Lots of great looking drawings of guts and gore, so much fun!</p>
<p>
Great book for anyone interested in medical history, one of the only downsides is that it can cost a bit, with my hardback copy costing me just under &#xA3;20, oh, and also the woman at the shop where I got the book from said something on the lines of "Looks like you're going to be on a list" - hahaha, piss off :-)
