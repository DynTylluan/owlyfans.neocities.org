            <p>Hi there, this website was made for the <font
                color="#000000"><a
                  href="https://hyperlink.neocities.org/wiki/hyperjam.html">August




                  2018 HyperJam</a>, the theme for the first HyperJam
                was Alternate History. For my theme I picked the idea of
                what if there was a cult in the mid-1990s that were on
                an island.<br>
              </font> </p>
            <p>I was impart inspired by the computer game <font
                color="#000000"><a
                  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dusk_%28video_game%29"><em>Dusk</em></a>
                with the cult theme, the television show <a
                  href="https://owlman.neocities.org/library/ted.html"><em>Father




                    Ted</em></a> with the idea of an offshore island,
                and I also had inspiration from the website <a
                  href="https://crowcult.neocities.org">CROWCULT</a> for
                the idea of a website about a cult. All of the events,
                and people in this project are a work of my own fiction,
                and are no wayy real.<br>
              </font> </p>
            <p>Despite that this project was made for HyperJam, I never
              sumited it, due to a number of events going on in the
              community at the time.<br>
