	<img align="right" hspace="15" src="paper2.png">
	Yesterday, two local idiots were arrested for being really, really dumb, police have said. Owl (an owl) and Goat (a goat), both idiots were caught doing some dumb act in public, because of course they were.</p>

	You would think that they would learn, but you would be wrong.</p>
