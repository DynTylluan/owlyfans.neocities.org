# Mirror of owlyfans.neocities.org

> You might be looking for [this git](https://github.com/DynTylluan/owly.fans), as this one is for the Neocities' version.

During the lifetime of my [OwlyFans website](https://owly.fans), it would live on [Neocities](https://neocities.org), being located at [owlyfans.neocities.org](https://owlyfans.neocities.org) - however, I would later abandon this website, opting to use its own domain, this would effectively mean that there are two versions of OwlyFans; the Neocities one that is now not being updated and the .fans version.

This git is a mirror of the Neocities version, meaning that parts of the website may be outdated for whatever reason - enjoy.
